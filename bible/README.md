This folder contains the effort of extracting bible verses from bible.com, combining them together, and experiment with hunalign sentence aligner to product parallel sentences.

Because bible verses are well aligned, so it's a good source to experiment with different parameters in sentence aligning.

TODOs:
* Add the one old testament chapter (Genesis) from gsungrab.com into the parallel sentences. That is not available on bible.com.
* Add non-verses (section titles, etc.) into the parallel sentence mining. Make make use of NavigableString.
* Remove fused verses in CTB translation, such as verses 19-22 in https://www.bible.com/bible/2378/1TH.5.CTB

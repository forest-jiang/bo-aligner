Learnings:

* Use token lemma greatly improved quality metrics.
* For "The Lady of the Camellias." the Tibetan translation aligns well with original French version, but not with English version.
* Tried different ways to do intra-paragraph sentence alignment. But it appears much more difficult. Revisit it later.
